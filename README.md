# Setting up repository for project
As the first step of this project, we set up the repository as per instructions.
We proceed to the design of the ER diagram, out of which we create the database schema by using the Forward Engineer feature. We populate the database with sample of data, to perform the remaining task.
We then solve module 2 exercices which consist in:
Adding Sales Report. Whereby, we create:
part 1:
Virtual table- join statement and a subquery
part 2:
- GetMaxQuantity - GetOrderDetail- CancelOrder

Exercice 2: Table Booking system
<bold>Important Notice:</bold> There no tasks in which it is asked to create a stored procedure name Manage Booking.
Then Module 3, in which we create requested visualization, and in the second exercice, the database client using jupyter notebook and the mysql-connector/python API.
